# <p align="center"> Thyroid Activity Classification and Prediction <br> Using Data Mining Techniques </p>


## Project Overview
This repository is part of a research initiative designed to leverage machine learning techniques for predicting thyroid gland activity. By analyzing clinical data, the project aims to classify thyroid conditions into hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or normal functioning (euthyroid), thereby assisting in the early diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders.

## Introduction
This project aims to apply advanced data mining techniques to predict thyroid gland activity, focusing on classifying conditions as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or normal (euthyroid) states. Using a comprehensive dataset from clinical sources, the project leverages machine learning to enhance diagnostic accuracies, contributing to better patient outcomes in endocrine health.

### Dataset
The analysis utilized a dataset comprising 9,172 instances, each encoded with 30 clinically relevant attributes including demographic data, hormonal levels, and patient-reported symptoms. Prior to modeling, the dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency, addressing challenges such as missing values and outlier effects.

### Methodological Framework

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning**: Removal of outliers and imputation of missing values to preserve data integrity.
- **Transformation**: Normalization and discretization techniques were applied to standardize the range of continuous variables and categorize them for effective analysis.


## Research Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately determine the activity of the thyroid gland based on clinical parameters. Utilizing decision tree algorithms, such as CART and C4.5, the project seeks to establish robust models that not only predict but also offer insights into the factors influencing thyroid conditions.

#### Discretization Visualizations
These visualizations illustrate the process of discretizing continuous variables, such as Free Thyroxine Index (FTI), Total T4 (TT4), and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Discretization helps in categorizing continuous variables into meaningful intervals, facilitating better analysis and interpretation of thyroid function.

## Data Analysis (data_analysis.py)
The main role of the script is to analyze, understand and locate problems in the data at the initial stage. Among other things, the actions of the script are:
- **Display various statistics**
- **Locate missing data**
- **Handle Missing Data:** Edit, if necessary, the missing information (delete, replace with average/median values, etc. according to the user's request)
